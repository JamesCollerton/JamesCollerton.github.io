						The turtle graphics project was one of my favourite ones
						that I did at university. It was written in C and interpreted
						a basic programming language LOGO to draw pictures to the screen. 
						The bulk of my time was spent getting this to work, especially 
						things like loops.

						</br></br>

						We were also asked to extend the program in any way we wanted. 
						Most people saw this as an invitation to extend the LOGO language,
						however I was less interested in this and more interested in 
						trying out a concept I had heard about called the <i> WhiteSpace
						language </i>. WhiteSpace is a programming language composed
						entirely out of newlines, tabs and spaces. I translated the LOGO
						language into something like WhiteSpace and made tools for doing this
						automatically and for interpreting it. Check out the video...

						Gravity was a game designed for a piece of Java programming
						coursework. It uses Swing graphics and one of the Java audio
						libraries to create a fun (ish) game where you play a little
						ball that jumps over obstacles as they come onto screen. There's
						powerups as well which is obviously insanely exciting.

						</br></br>

						Some things to note about it are that the ball is animated under
						gravity, the need for threading and the OO design. The ball can
						switch between travelling along the top of the screen and the bottom,
						and the idea was to try and program that cleverly enough to add
						an extra dimension to the game, with minimal work.

						</br></br>

						Something I really wanted to try and take away from this project
						was the use of threading in programs. I had previously done some
						programming in C, so was used to a very procedural way of thinking,
						not a lot of things happening concurrently. Marrying into that is
						the concept of Object Orientated design, so thinking about classes
						having responsibilities rather than breaking a program down
						into linear steps.

						This wasn't one of the biggest courseworks I did and wasn't
						one of the most important ones. I definitely think that it
						was one of the ones I enjoyed the most though! It comprised 
						of designing an API for a fridge that connect to the internet
						using a Python binding for SQLite.

						</br></br>

						This was definitely a case of one of those projects that developed
						through the "Yeah, but wouldn't it be cool if it... " mentality. 
						By the end the API could email you things that had just gone out
						of date, look up products by their barcode on an internet database,
						recommend you recipes based on what you had in the fridge and even
						connect to Facebook to automatically post statuses about what you
						were eating (handy for a lot of people I know...).

						This was another coursework in written in C. It used
						a recursive method of solving mazes written in .txt files.
						Given a maze it will tell you if it is possible to solve it,
						and if it is then it will render the result in SDL.

						</br></br>

						An additional part of the coursework was to be able to randomly
						generate mazes and then solve them for you. It wasn't one of my
						favourite courseworks, but it was good to learn a little bit
						more about principles like recursion. Also, I really enjoy
						programming in C.
