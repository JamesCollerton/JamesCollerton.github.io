In my spare time I developed the FlashApp android application, an application
that uses Guide Number mathematics to ascertain exposure levels for film photography.

Aside from that I have taught programming on a voluntary basis at my local library, participated
in the Advent of Code programming challenge and began developing my own services ecosystem to
gain experience of microservices.
