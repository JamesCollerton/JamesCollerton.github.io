My favourite programming language is Java but recently I have been investigating Scala. 
In addition I have been developing my own set of services which can be found on GitHub.
This has been an opportunity to use Spring Boot, the Netflix stack, Terraform and AWS. 
Although I am absolutely not an expert in the services department I am enjoying learning 
about the area and hope to be able to employ my findings professionally soon.
