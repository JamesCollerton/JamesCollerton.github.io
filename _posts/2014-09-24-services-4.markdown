I am always keen to learn new technologies. My favourite programming language is Java
but recently I have been investigating Scala. 

Lately I have been developing my own set of services, which can be found on my GitHub.
This has been an opportunity to use Spring Boot, the Netflix stack, Terraform and AWS. 
Although I am absolutely not an expert in the services department I am enjoying learning 
about the area and hope to be able to employ my learning professionally soon.
