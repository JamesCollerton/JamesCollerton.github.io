I recieved a First in Mathematics from the University of Bristol with my bachelor's project helping me win a research grant offer from the EPSRC.

I then pursued a Master's in Computer Science where I achieved a distinction, graduating top of my cohort in the taught modules. My thesis focussed on using machine learning algorithms to derive differential equation models of ant emigration behaviour.
