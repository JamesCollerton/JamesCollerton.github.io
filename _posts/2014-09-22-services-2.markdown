I recieved a first in mathematics from the University of Bristol with my bachelor's project on nonparametric 
regression, wavelets and their applications helping me win a research grant offer from the EPSRC.

I then pursued a Master's in Computer Science where I achieved a distinction, graduating top of my cohort in 
my taught modules. My thesis focussed on using machine learning algorithms to derive differential equation 
models of ant emigration behaviour.
