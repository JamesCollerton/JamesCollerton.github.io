I studied an undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol achieving a first in mathematics. 
My bachelor's project on nonparametric regression, wavelets and their applications helped me win
a research grant offer from the EPSRC.

After teaching myself some programming in second year I pursued a Master's in Computer Science where
I achieved a distinction graduating top of my cohort in my taught modules. My thesis focussed on
using machine learning algorithms to derive differential equation models of ant emigration behaviour.
