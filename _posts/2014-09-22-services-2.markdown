I recieved a First in Mathematics from the University of Bristol with my bachelor's project helping me win a research grant offer from the EPSRC.

I then pursued a Master's in Computer Science where I achieved a distinction, graduating top of my cohort in the taught modules with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/computationalantlab/projects/learning-population-dynamics-in">my thesis</a> focussed on using machine learning algorithms to derive differential equation models.
