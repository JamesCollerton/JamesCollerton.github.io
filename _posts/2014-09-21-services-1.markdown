I've spent the last two and a half years working at Kobalt Music Group, where I've been helping
build the Neighbouring Rights technology team. As part of this I've been building systems handling
millions of records of data, running technical projects and helping develop more junior members
of my company.

Previously I've worked as a consultant to Unilever, Glaxosmithkline and Oxford University helping
them leverage technology and data to further their businesses.

However, my technology career began as an intern at university where I worked with a company SPARX,
helping them develop systems for teaching KS2 children mathematics.
