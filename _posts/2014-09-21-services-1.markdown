I've spent the last two and a half years working at Kobalt Music Group building systems handling
millions of records of data, running technical projects and helping develop more junior members
of the company.

Previously I've worked as a consultant to Unilever, Glaxosmithkline and Oxford University assisting
them leverage technology and data to further their businesses.

However, my technology career began as an intern at university where I worked with a company SPARX,
aiding them in building systems for teaching KS2 children mathematics.
