Recently I've been working at Kobalt Music Group programming as a developer helping run technical
projects and develop the Neighbouring Rights department.

Previously I've worked as a consultant to Unilever, Glaxosmithkline and Oxford University assisting
them leverage technology and data to further their businesses.

However, my technology career began as an intern at university where I worked with a company SPARX,
aiding them in building systems for teaching KS2 children mathematics.
